Running this backend service requires a [Go installation](https://golang.org/doc/install), and a correct configuration of GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables.

For example, when cloning the GoBlockChat repository, the repo should be located within the "src" directory of a GoWorkspace, as referenced by the GOPATH environment variable.

If the GOPATH is defined as "C:/Users/user/GoWorkspace", then this repo should be found under "C:/Users/<user>/GoWorkspace/src/github.com/denverquane/GoBlockChat".
