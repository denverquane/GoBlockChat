This app seeks to demonstrate using blockchain tech. for a chat application like Slack or Discord.

By using the blockchain, no user can delete, modify, or falsify chat records and exchanges without other users
being aware of the change. This not ensures integrity of the chat, but allows for interesting functionality 
regarding "rewinding" or rollback of chat engagements.

## Goals:
- [ ] Proof of Work for posting messages/blocks (prevent spam/abuse)
- [ ] Discovery of other Nodes
- [ ] Author/poster validation (login validation)
- [ ] GUI for chat/chain refresh, etc
